# ARCHITECTURE: AE Subtitle

## System Overview

AE Subtitle is a small After Effects ScriptUI panel plus a local Python helper. The Python side can run as a local-only server started by a macOS `.command` launcher, and still exposes a CLI for direct testing.

## Components

### ScriptUI Panel

Purpose:
- Provide a dockable After Effects panel with one primary action: `Generate Subtitle`.
- Validate the active comp and source layer.
- Call the local Python server. The user keeps `AE Subtitle.command` open while generating.
- Parse transcript JSON.
- Rebuild subtitle text layers.

Responsibilities:
- Find active comp.
- Accept any active comp name.
- Find one usable layer with `layer.source.file.fsName`, or a simple nested precomp containing such a layer.
- Build a shell-safe `curl` command for the local server.
- Delete existing layers whose names start with `SUB `.
- Create one text layer per transcript segment.
- Apply default paragraph, position, color, and stroke/shadow settings.
- Report success or clear errors to the user.

### Python Server / CLI

Purpose:
- Keep Whisper and ffmpeg work outside ExtendScript.
- Return stable transcript JSON to the panel.

Responsibilities:
- Accept source media path and output cache path.
- Reuse sidecar cache when source fingerprint matches.
- Extract audio with ffmpeg when needed.
- Transcribe Thai and English speech with a local Whisper-compatible engine.
- Apply editable campaign glossary corrections from Markdown.
- Clean segment text.
- Write transcript JSON atomically.
- Print JSON path or machine-readable status for the JSX caller.

### macOS Launcher

Purpose:
- Let the user double-click `AE Subtitle.command`, check/install dependencies, start/adopt the local server, view status, and view logs.

Responsibilities:
- Create `.venv` only when missing.
- Install Python dependencies only when `aesubtitle` or `faster_whisper` is missing.
- Check `ffmpeg` before attempting installation.
- Start `python -m aesubtitle.server` on `127.0.0.1:8765`.
- Keep the Terminal window open while the user clicks `Generate Subtitle` in After Effects.

### Transcript Cache

Sidecar file next to source media:

```text
voice-over.wav
voice-over.aesubtitle.json
```

Contract:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source_file": "voice-over.wav",
  "source_path": "/path/to/voice-over.wav",
  "source_fingerprint": {
    "size_bytes": 123456,
    "modified_at": "2026-05-22T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "duration_seconds": 30.0,
  "language": "th",
  "model": "large-v3",
  "glossary_fingerprint": {
    "path": "/path/to/glossary.md",
    "size_bytes": 1234,
    "modified_at": "2026-05-22T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "timebase": "source_seconds",
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 2.4,
      "text": "สวัสดีครับ welcome everyone"
    }
  ]
}
```

If `glossary.md` exists, the Python side applies it before writing the cache and stores its fingerprint. Changing the glossary invalidates the cache.

## Timing Model

MVP uses source seconds directly as comp seconds.

This is valid when the active comp contains the voice-over source starting at comp time `0`, with no time remap, speed change, trim, or nested offset. A simple nested comp is supported only when each timing layer also starts at `0` with normal speed. More complex mapping is deferred.

## Text Layer Model

Each transcript segment becomes one ordinary text layer:

- Name: `SUB 001`, `SUB 002`, etc.
- `inPoint`: `segment.start`
- `outPoint`: `segment.end`
- Source text: wrapped segment text.
- Position: bottom center.
- Style: white fill, black stroke or shadow.

## Campaign Glossary

The root `glossary.md` file uses a small Markdown format:

```md
- canonical: Shopee Payday
  variants:
    - shopee payday
    - ชอบพี่เพเด
```

`canonical` is the text that should appear in subtitles. `variants` are exact model mistakes or alternate spellings. After exact replacements, a conservative fuzzy pass can correct near Thai matches such as `ทั่วชัย` to `ทั่วไทย` when the glossary contains `ทั่วไทย`.

## Suggested Future File Structure

```text
ae/
  AE Subtitle.jsx
python/
  pyproject.toml
  aesubtitle/
    cli.py
    transcriber.py
    models.py
    cache.py
tests/
  fixtures/
docs/
  manual-qa.md
```

## Validation Strategy

- Unit-test Python cache, transcript model, and text wrapping logic.
- Smoke-test CLI against a tiny fixture audio file.
- Manually test JSX in After Effects because ExtendScript execution is hard to automate reliably.
- Keep ScriptUI behavior small enough for manual QA to be credible.

## CI Position

Do not create placeholder CI before implementation exists. Add CI in the foundation issue once Python package and smoke tests exist.
